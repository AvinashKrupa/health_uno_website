        <br />
        <p>
          Users can choose the Practitioner as per their preferences and
          availability of Consultants. In cases where Users cannot choose a
          Practitioner (due to non-availability of slots, unexpected
          cancellations from the physician due to emergencies, non-availability
          of slots due to full bookings), the user can choose another physician
          from the available list of Practitioners at their own discretion and
          preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case any prescription is being provided to User by the
          Practitioner, the same is being provided basis the online
          consultation, based on the complaints mentioned by the user. It is the

          physicians to the best of their knowledge without hiding any relevant
          information. The diagnosis and follow up treatment and investigations
          advised to the user are based on the aforementioned replies given by
          the user, hence the user accepts that S/He will disclose all relevant
          information to the treating physician and the diagnosis, treatment and
          investigation reports recommended will depend purely on the
          aforementioned interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Users agree to use the advice from Practitioner on the Website
          pursuant to:

          examination or medical attention;

          The User agrees that by using Healthuno, The Practitioners on
          Healthuno will not be conducting physical examination of the Users
          directly but through the available ANM/Nurse in the Kiosk, hence, they
          may not have or be able to derive important information that is
          usually obtained through a physical examination. User acknowledges and
          agrees that the User is aware of this limitation and agrees to assume
          the complete risk of this limitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The User understands that Healthuno Consultations shall not form a
          substitute for treatment that otherwise needs physical
          examination/immediate consultation. Further, the User understands that
          the advice provided by the Practitioner is based on general medical
          conditions and practices prevalent in India, to the best of his
          knowledge and ability, and not for conditions which are territory
          specific for regions other than India, irrespective of where the User
          is procuring medical services or engaging in communication with the
          Practitioner.
